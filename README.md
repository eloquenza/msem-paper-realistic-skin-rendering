## Metropolis

**FORKED CHANGE**

Forking this to save this repository as a base for me, and to include a version of this template that I modified to better fit into my university's (Hochschule Hannover) corporate design.

Switch to the master branch to retrieve the original sources.
This branch was created to ease my development of presentations.
